## cl-liballegro
cl-liballegro provides bindings to Allegro5 which already provides fantastic documentation: https://liballeg.org/a5docs/trunk/

The documentation that will be provided here is therefore meant for idioms, usages, and general use of these bindings that are more specific to Common Lisp

## Basic usage
The most basic usage is 1-to-1 just uses the bindings "as is", with an example [here](https://github.com/resttime/cl-liballegro/blob/master/examples/simple-window.lisp)

In this case most function names simply match and there's not much different `al_init();` becomes `(al:init)`

## cffi
Occasionally there are times when dropping down to a lower level to using CFFI is required. This usually happens when a data structure is passed by reference to a function

```c
{
  ALLEGRO_EVENT event;
  bool running = true;
  while (running) process_event(&event);
}
```
In Common Lisp we use CFFI to allocate the structure, and then the corresponding functions from the Allegro5 library can take those in. Remember to free up the memory!
```lisp
(defparameter *running-p* t)
(let ((event (cffi:foreign-alloc '(:union al:event)))
  ;; do stuff with event here like an event loop
  (loop while *running-p* do (process-event event))
  ;; free after done
  (cffi:foreign-free event))
```
